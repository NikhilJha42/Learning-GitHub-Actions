# Learning GitHub Actions

Repository for learning about GitHub Actions.

## Aims
- Use GitHub Actions to automate:
  - Unit testing.
  - Integration.
  - Deployment.
- Put together the above three processes to build a CI/CD pipeline.

## Steps
- Create a simple React webpage using Test Driven Development.
- Set up an action to automatically run unit tests when code is pushed.
- Create an action to merge code from a development branch to the main branch.
- Create a deployment action.
- Amalgamate the automated testing, integration and deployment actions into a CI/CD pipeline, so that changes to the code are reflected in the deployed webpage within minutes.
